= Component wise comparison for hardware inventory details

Hardware inventory details needs component wise comparison.

== Problem description

* Currently, we are comparing hardware inventory details with entire file and
  if it is not equal we are updating all the component details in etcd. Problem
  here is if any changes in one component details then updation happens for all
  the component.

== Use Cases

None

== Proposed change

* Instead of comparing hardware inventory details with entire file, Compare
  component wise. It will reduce number of etcd request.

== Implementation

* The comparison logic needs to be component wise comparison.
* if any component details are not changed then delete that from hardware inventory
  list. So only changed is passed to onpull function.
```
old_data = "from hardware inventory file"
if new_data['component_name'] == old_data['component_name']:
    del  new_data['component_name']

write new_data in file and pass it to onpull function
```
