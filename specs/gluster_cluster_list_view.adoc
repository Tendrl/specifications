= Tendrl Definitions: Display list of clusters discovered by Tendrl

Display list of Gluster clusters present in Tendrl. The list should have functionality for 

* filtering by name.
* sorting by name, status, cluster version and managed.

Cluster list will be sorted by name by default.

View design will look like:

image::upadtedClusterList.png[Upadted Cluster List]

== Problem description

Tendrl should show list of Gluster clusters present by Tendrl along with their details.

The details shown for each cluster in UI is -

* Cluster Name
* Status
* Managed State
* Cluster Version
* Import button(if ready to import)
* Launch Dashboard button(if already imported)
* Cluster Details button(if already imported)
* Message to state cluster configurable state for eg. ready to import, cluster misconfigured.

The workflow is as follows:

* API will provide the list of clusters to the Tendrl.

* User can click on expand icon of each cluster record to see the events/notifications and hosts associated with it.

* In the hosts tab, host name and IP address will be displayed.

* Based on the managed state, import/launch dasboard/cluster details buttons will be displayed for each cluster.
  * If Managed state is "Yes", Launch dashboard and cluster details button will be displayed.
  * If Managed state is "No" and cluster is ready to import, Import button will be displayed.
  * If Managed state is "No" and cluster is not properly configured, Imported will be disabled.

* Clicking Import button will take to import cluster workflow.

* Clicking Launch dashboard button will launch the dashboard in a new tab of browser.

* Clicking Cluster details button will take to cluster objects details page. This flow is handled in separate spec- https://github.com/Tendrl/specifications/issues/216.

== Use Casess

Users can see the list of cluster present in Tendrl. They can also 

* filtering by name.
* sorting by name, status, cluster version and managed.

== Proposed change

* Create a view for listing clusters.
* Use the patternfly expanded list views design to display list of clusters.
* Implement client side filer and sorting functionality using angular's filter and orderby components.
* Send polling call after 10 seconds to get the updated data. 
* Show total count of clusters present in Tendrl.

Tendrl API related changes:

* Get API call for getting cluster list.

=== Alternatives

Generate list component can be created and used for listing the cluster. But because of its complexity and time constraint, we will pick this up later.

=== Data model impact:
See 'Impacted Modules' section where all the details are populated.

=== Impacted Modules:

==== Tendrl API impact:

/api/1.0/GetClusterList - fetch the list of clusters

Sample API Response - required.

API support present for -

* Status
* Cluster Name
* Cluster Version

Required from API - 

* Managed State
* Message to state cluster configurable for eg. ready to import, cluster misconfigured.
* Host IP address for displaying it under "Hosts" tab of expanded view.

Backend implementation is being tracked in github issue: https://github.com/Tendrl/specifications/issues/211

== Implementation:

* Cluster Name, version, status, managed state will be taken from the API response to display it on the cluster list view.
