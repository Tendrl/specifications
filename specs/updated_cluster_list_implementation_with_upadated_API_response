= Tendrl Definitions: Display list of unmanaged gluster clusters discovered by Tendrl

Display list of unmanaged gluster clusters present in Tendrl. The list should have functionality for 

* filtering by name.
* sorting by name, status, cluster version and managed.

Cluster list will be sorted by name by default.

View design will look like:

image::upadtedClusterList.png[Upadted Cluster List]

== Problem description

Tendrl should show list of unmanaged gluster clusters present in Tendrl along with their details.

The details shown for each cluster in UI is -

* Cluster Name
* Status
* Managed State
* Cluster Version
* Import button
* Message to state cluster configurable state for eg. ready to import, cluster misconfigured.

The workflow is as follows:

* API will provide the list of clusters to the Tendrl.

* User can click on expand icon of each cluster record to see the error messages and hosts associated with it.

* In the hosts tab, host fqdn and role will be displayed.

* If Managed state is "No" and cluster is ready to import, Import button will be displayed.

* If Managed state is "No" and cluster is not properly configured, Import button will be disabled.

* Clicking Import button will take to import cluster workflow.

== Use Casess

Users can see the list of unmanaged gluster cluster present in Tendrl. They can also 

* filter by name.
* sort by name, status, cluster version and managed.

== Proposed change

* Will use the existing cluster list view which will now display the unmanaged clusters as well.
