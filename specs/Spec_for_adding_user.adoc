# User Management: Adding new User in Tendrl

## Problem description

This spec talks about Adding/Creating a new User to Tendrl by the Admin

## Use Cases

The flow goes as follows:-

* A user logs in as Admin
* Clicks on Admin tab in Navigation
* The navigation drops down
* Clicks on *Users*
* Clicks on *Add* button in Users page view

User will land onto https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/KNB25OEQT#/screens/226063802[Add Users] page

## Proposed change

* Add *Users* tab in Admin navigation tab
* Add *Add User* Button in Users Page view
* Add a form for adding a user. The form will contain following feilds:-
** User ID
*** Input type : text
*** Validations:
**** Should be Unique

*NOTE*: 

* The fields ```First Name``` and ```Last Name``` will be assigned value from the API property ```name``` by splitting it at space.
* Maximum length for field ```name``` : 100 Characters

### Impacted Modules:

}

```

	"username": "JDoe1",
	"name" : "John Doe",

}

```

API support present for -
