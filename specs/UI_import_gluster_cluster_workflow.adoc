= Import gluster cluster workflow

== Problem description

This specification describes import gluster cluster workflow which is a mechanism to add an gluster storage cluster into tendrl for management.

View design will look like:

image::import.png[Import workflow]

== Use Cases

This addresses the use case of importing existing gluster clusters into tendrl for management.

The workflow is as follows:

* API will provide the list of clusters(imported and ready to import) and those clusters will be displayed on cluster list page.

* A button will be displayed for each cluster which are not imported and are ready to import.

* If the cluster has some errors, the import button will be disabled for it on cluster list page. Hence the user can't see import cluster view for it. 

* User will click on the import button for the cluster, he wants to import.

* User will be redirected to new view.

* UI will filter the available nodes for importing the cluster.

* The view will list down the available nodes and a checkbox for enabling/disabling the cluster wide volume profiling.

* Each node's fqdn, release and role(Server/Peer) will be shown.

* User can perform following operations on the node list.

** filter by fqdn and role.

** sort by fqdn and role.

* User can check/uncheck if he wants to enable/disable the volume profiling.

* All the available nodes will participate in the import cluster workflow.

* User clicks the import button to begin the import operation.

* Success message will be shown once import operation successfully started.

* Along with successful message, there will be two buttons - View Task Progress and Cancel.

* Clicking on cancel button will take the user to cluster list page.

* Clicking on task progress button will take the user task detail page.

== Proposed change

* Figure out the cluster which can be imported(whose is_managed property will be "No").
* Create a view for displaying the import details for the cluster.
* Create a factory which will call the API for getting node list of the importing cluster.
* Create a store to have mapping between API property name and UI variable and can do any data manipulation for the flow on the data send from factory.
* Show total count of nodes present in a gluster cluster.
* Implement client side filter and sorting functionality using angularâ€™s filter and orderby components.

Import cluster flow requires the below APIs to be exposed:
