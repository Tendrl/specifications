= Create file share workflow by using tendrl-frontend UI

The intent of create file share workflow is to provide a mechanism to create a file share based on one of the following volume types: 2-way and 3-way distributed replicated and erasure coded/distributed dispersed(4+2 with minimum 6 bricks, 8+3 with minimum 11 bricks, or 8+4 with minimum 12 bricks).

* Assumption: 

    - Only following volume types will be supported 

        * 2-way and 3-way distributed replicated

        * Erasure coded/distributed dispersed (4+2 with minimum 6 bricks, 8+3 with minimum 11 bricks, or 8+4 with minimum 12 bricks)
