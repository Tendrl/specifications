# User Management: User List View for Admin

## Problem description

This spec talks about the implementation of *User List* view. This view will list down all existing users.

## Use Cases

The flow goes as follows:-

* A user logs in as Admin
* Clicks on Admin tab in Navigation
* The navigation drops down
* Clicks on *Users*

User will land onto https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/KNB25OEQT#/screens/226063808[User list] view page

## Proposed workflow

### UI

There are following features involved in this view:-

* Filter: To filter out User on the basis of:-
** User ID (username)
** Last Name
** Role
* *Add* Button, which directs to https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/KNB25OEQT#/screens/226063802[Add user] view
* User Table containing following columns:-
** User ID (username)
** First Name
** Last Name
** Role(s)
*** Admin
*** Normal User
*** Limited User
** Notification
*** Enabled
*** Disabled
** Email
** Actions
*** Edit Button -  Takes to https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/KNB25OEQT#/screens/226063805[Edit User] view


*NOTE*: 

* The fields ```First Name``` and ```Last Name``` will be assigned value from the API property ```name``` by splitting it at space.

### Impacted Modules:

#### Tendrl API impact:

```
GET /api/1.0/users - List the existing user
```

* Current sample API response: 

```
[{
	"email": "admin@tendrl.org",
	"username": "admin",
	"name": "Admin",
	"role": "admin"
}]
```

* Sample API response Required:

```
{
	"username": "JDoe1",
	"name": "John Doe",
	"role": "admin",
	"email_notifications": "true",
	"email": "jdoe@tendrl.org"	
}

```

API support present for -

* email
* username
* name
* role

Required from API - 

* email_notifications

#### Notifications/Monitoring impact:

If ```email_notifications = true ```, notifications are required to be monitored
