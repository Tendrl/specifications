# User Management: Editing User view for Admin

## Problem description

This spec talks about viewing or editing information stored about a single user.

## Use Cases

The flow goes as follows:-

* A user logs in as Admin
* Clicks on Admin tab in Navigation
* The navigation drops down
* Clicks on *Users*
* Clicks on *Edit* option for a particular user

User will land onto https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/KNB25OEQT#/screens/226063805[Edit User] view page

## Proposed workflow

### UI

Edit user view consist of a form:-

* ```User ID``` - Not Editable
* First Name
** Input type: text
* Last Name
** Input type: text
* Email
** Input type: email
** validation : Input should be a valid email
* Email Notifications - whether user should receive notifications
** Input type: checkbox
* Password
** Input type: password
** Validation: Should be minimum of 8 characters
** Should contain a Show/Hide button for password visibility. The default visibility will be *hidden*.
* Confirm Password
** Input type: password
** Validation: Should match password
** Should contain a Show/Hide button for password visibility. The default visibility will be *hidden*.
* Select a Role
** Roles: Admin, Normal, Limited
** The default will be the current assigned role of User
* ```Save``` button
** This button commits changes and returns to User List view page.
*  ```Cancel``` button
** Will be active always
** After clicking on this button, User will be redirected to User List view page

*NOTE*: 

* The fields ```First Name``` and ```Last Name``` will be assigned value from the API property ```name``` by splitting it at space.
* Maximum length for field ```name``` : 100 Characters

### Impacted Modules:

#### Tendrl API impact:

```
PUT /api/1.0/users/username - Update an existing user.
```

* Sample API response now : 

```
{
	"email": "thardy@tendrl.org",
	"username": "thardy",
	"name": "Tom Hardee",
	"role": "normal"
}
```

* Sample API response:

```
{
	"username": "JDoe1",
	"name": "John Doe"
	"role": "admin",
	"email_notifications": "true",
	"email": "jdoe@tendrl.org",
}

```

API support present for -

* email
