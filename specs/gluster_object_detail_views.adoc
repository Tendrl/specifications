= Tendrl Definitions: Display list of volume and host associated with a gluster cluster discovered by Tendrl

== Problem description

Display list of volume and host associated with a gluster cluster present in Tendrl. 

*Host List*

The details shown for each host are -

* Status
* Name(fqdn)
* Role
* Alerts

The host list should have functionality for 

* filtering by name, role and status.
* sorting by name and role.

Host list will be sorted by name by default.

View design will look like:

image::hostList.png[Gluster specific host list view]

*Volume List*

The details shown for each volume are -

* Status
* Name
* Type
* Brick Count
* Alerts
* Running: Yes/No
* Last Rebalance

The volume list should have functionality for 

* filtering by name, type and status.
* sorting by name and status.

Volume list will be sorted by name by default.

View design will look like:

image::volumeList.png[Gluster specific host list view]

The workflow is as follows:

* API will provide the list of volume asscociated with a gluster cluster to the Tendrl.

* API will provide the list of hosts present in Tendrl and UI will find the associated host with a gluster cluster.

* User will click on *Cluster Details" button from cluster list view to go to object details view.

* Two tabs will be displayed on the page: Hosts and Volumes

* Clicking hosts tab will list down the hosts associated with that gluster cluster.

* Clicking volumes tab will list down the volumes associated with that gluster cluster.

== Use Casess

Display list of volume and host associated with a gluster cluster present in Tendrl. 

== Proposed change

* Create a view for cluster object detail which will have two tab: Hosts and Volumes.
* Create components for hosts and volumes list page.
* Implement client side filter and sorting functionality using angular's filter and orderby components.
* Send polling call after 10 seconds for volume list and 30 seconds for host list to get the updated data. 
* Show total count of volumes and hosts present for the glsuter cluster in Tendrl.

Tendrl API related changes:

* Get API call for getting host list.
* Get API call for getting volume list.
