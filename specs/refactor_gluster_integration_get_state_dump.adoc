= Refactor Gluster Integration's state dump module


The gluster get-state output is consumed by tendrl-gluster-integration, we
need to refactor the way Tendrl consumes and processes the get-state output

Notes:

* In light of new changes to gluster get-state
  http://review.gluster.org/#/c/15889

== Problem description

Current Tendrl way of consuming and processing is not robust enough to adopt
with the Tendrl object namespacing, We also need to accomodate latest
changes to the gluster get-state output.

== Use Cases

This addresses the use case of obtaining refereshed gluster cluster state

== Proposed change

* General re-factoring of code handling gluster get-state

* Accomodate latest changes to output of gluster get-state w.r.t volume options
